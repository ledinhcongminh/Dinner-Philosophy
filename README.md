# Dinner-Philosophy
Studying the behavior of agents to solve the problem of the Philosophy Dinner:

A philosopher needs two dining forks. If the fork is taken, it will not be released until a philosopher has finished eating. Each philosopher cycles: taking, eating, depositing, and thinking.
One of the (worst) possible states of such a system is reached when five philosophers are hungry at the same time and each takes a fork from the table.

I solve this problem using Multi Agent System in coding in Java.
